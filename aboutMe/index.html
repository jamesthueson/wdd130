            <p>My degree is CIT. But I am hoping to make a career path as a blockchain developer.
                I find this field super interesting and world changing which makes me want to be apart of it.
                I enjoy playing tennis and growing my buisness.</p>
            <p>I am married to my beautiful wife Sarah. We currently do not have any children. Me and my wife are creating a graphic design business. 
                What I love about BYU-I is the community associated with it. Even though some of us are far away from home we all feel a sense of unity 
                with each other. My degree is CIT. I am taking this course for an inteded purpose of creating a bio page to update with projects that I am working on. This class 
                will help me advertise myself to employers. I have been a member of the church my whole life, and my favorite scripture is Psalm 23:1 "The LORD is my shepherd; I shall not want."</p>
